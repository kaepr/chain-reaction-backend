# Chain Reaction Online Backend

Backend implementation of the chain reaction game. 

[Frontend implementation](https://github.com/standmarsh/chain-reaction-frontend)

## About
Chain reaction is a multiplayer game, in which players are assigned colors and take turns placing cells on the board. As soon as a cell reaches its limit, the cell explodes and spreads into the adjacent cells, changing the cell's color. As soon as the whole board is covered in a single color, the respective player wins.

The project uses Express, Socket.io and MongoDB. It uses JsonWebToken and redis for handling user authentication. Tests for the user and auth routes written using Jest.

## Project Setup

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/standmarsh/chain-reaction-backend.git
